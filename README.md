# Abstract
Elevator waiting times in multi-storey buildings remain a persistent challenge in modern building operations. This project proposes a predictive standby dispatch strategy that uses a machine learning–based multi-label classification model to forecast short-term elevator hall calls and proactively reposition idle elevators. By introducing this proactive standby behaviour, the system aims to reduce passenger waiting time while avoiding unnecessary movement and energy cost.

A Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is adopted as the predictor to capture temporal patterns in historical elevator call records. Owing to the lack of publicly available real-world datasets, a realistic elevator traffic simulator is developed to generate synthetic call data across different building configurations and traffic densities. The trained models are integrated into an idle repositioning module within a simulated Elevator Group Control System (EGCS), and the proposed strategy is evaluated against a traditional reactive dispatch baseline as well as Tsai’s standby method.

The results indicate that models optimised for high precision consistently deliver the largest performance gains, as false repositioning actions are reduced and effective idle movements are better utilised. The proposed strategy have the best prmance in low-density environments, where idle elevators are more frequently available for repositioning.In contrast, its effectiveness decreases in high-density conditions, where the system workload is saturated and chances for proactive repositioning are limited. Notably, the TCN-based approach achieves higher saved time per reposition and a lower increase in movement cost compared with Tsai’s strategy, suggesting a more efficient use of idle elevator capacity.
Overall, this study shows that machine learning–driven predictive standby dispatch can serve as a practical and cost-efficient enhancement to conventional elevator control systems, particularly in buildings with low traffic demand.
